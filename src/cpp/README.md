# C++ 

C++ was developer by Bjarne Stroustrup back in 1985. It built upon the C language by adding the object oriented (OO) paradigm to C. This primarily mean't added classes, but ofcourse a whole lot more. Just like C, C++ is a compiled language. 

C++ is in many ways the real root of C languages with classes, Java, C# etc.

### Hello World

I'm using the Visual Studio Dev Prompt and cl.exe to compile C++ but you might prefer to use g++ or clang compilers. Assuming you're following along with cl.exe and you've openend the prompt in the correct folder then run the following for simple single file compilation

```
cl helloWorld.cpp
```

As C++ is a compiled language, this command will build an obj file then link that to create an executable which we can then run.

### Basic types and assignment

Just like C, C++ has a fair few basic types, signed, unsigned etc. as you'd expect as it's basically an extension of C. But along with basic types comes OO capabilities by the inclusion of classes.
