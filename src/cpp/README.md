# C++ 

## Hello World

I'm using the Visual Studio Dev Prompt and cl.exe to compile C++, so assuming you've openend the prompt in the correct folder then run the following for simple single file compilation

```
cl helloWorld.cpp
```

As C++ is a compiled language, this command will build an executable which we can then run.
