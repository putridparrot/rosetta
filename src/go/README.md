# Go Samples

Go was designed by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson at Google.

It's a statically typed, compiled language which has a C-like syntax. Go tries to remove some of the common pitfuls developers have had with C/C++ such as around memory safety by including garbage collection. 

Go and Rust are both languages which one might feel are there to replace C/C++ with languages that try to help developers with their handling of memory.
