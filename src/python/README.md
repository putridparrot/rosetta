# Python Samples

Python was released in 1991 having been designd by Guido van Rossum. Python is a dynamic language that uses duck tying  and therefore a more "shape" approach to declaring custom types. 

It's a language that uses indentation and therefore white space instead of curly braces (such as the C derived languages) to denote code blocks.

Whilst Python has been around quite a while and is often viewed as a popular language, with the advent of data science and AI usage it's become a lot more mainstream.

Python is an intepreted language although there are several cross compilers which convert Python to other languages which can then be compiled, however they obviously are restricted to a subset of features.
