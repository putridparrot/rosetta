# Java

The Java languages is a high level language that has it's synatical roots in C/C++. Initially developed by James Gosling one of the key features of Java (other than the language and framework features) is the compilation to bytecode not binaries like C/C++.

Java compiles to an intermediate langauge or more commonly known in Java as bytecode which then runs on a virtual machines known as the JVM.

Unlike C/C++ this means the the actual compiled code can be run on different OS's and architectures without a recompilation step.
