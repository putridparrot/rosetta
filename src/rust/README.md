# Rust

Rust is a compiled language hence running the following will, by default, compile to an executable. 

It's syntactically similar to C++ and like Go it tries to address some of the memory safety concerns of developers using C/C++.

### Hello World

We can compile our Rust files using _rustc_

```
rustc helloWorld.rs
```

Rustaceans (developers who use Rust) tend to use _cargo_  for their builds as well as for package management, in which case we would run the following command from the folder with your .rs file

```
cargo run
```

We'll use _cargo_ in any examples.
