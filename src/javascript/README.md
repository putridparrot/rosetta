# JavaScript Samples

JavaScript (JS) was originally designed as a scripting language and engine for inclusion within web browsers. Initially dsesigned by Brendan Eich at Netscape at the time to allow scripting within web pages. 

With Java as part of the name might suggest a syntactical and design lineage to Java - actually it is more a case of the name come from a replacement for Java applets as, whilst the language will look familiar to a Java developer there are quite a few key differences in the language.

JavaScript is an intepreted language runnin within the JavaScript engine (such the Chrome V8 engine). 

Initially designed for the web browser the development of Node.js in 2009 (created by Ryan Dahl) allows JavaScript to run outside of the browser, essentially allowing JavaScript to run on the server as well as web clients.

_We will be using Node.js to run any examples, just to demonstrate the language features without the need for web server or browsers etc._

A key feature of JavaScript is that it's dynamic, essentially meaning we have weak typing.
