# Kotlin Samples

## Language Overview

Kotlin is a language developed by JetBrains. Which compiles down to bytecode (the Java Virtual Machine/JVM). It's statically typed and whilst cross platform it's probably best known as an alternative to Java for Android development.

We can compile kotlin code to a .jar and then use java to runthe .jar, for example

```
kotlinc main.kt -include-runtime -d main.jar
java -jar main.jar
```
