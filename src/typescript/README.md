# TypeScript Samples

## Hello World

To run TypeScript code we first transpile it using _tsc_ which generates the JavaScript which we'll run using _node_.

_Note: As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, you may find there's absolutelty no difference between TS and JS code, but we'll simply run via the tsc transpiler anyway._

```
tsc helloWorld.ts && node helloWorld.js
```
