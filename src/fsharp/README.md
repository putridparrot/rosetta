# F#

F# is a .NET language developed by Don Syme at Microsoft and release in 2005. 

It's a functional first language which basically means the language is functional but you can use object oriented design also but the preference is to write code in a functional way. As F# compiles to .NET intermediate language this allows F# to use the existing .NET framework libraries.

It's an indented/white space significant language. The language uses indentation to denot new code blocks.
